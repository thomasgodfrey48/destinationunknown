Rationale:

I have chosen the topic of sports broadcasting as it is an area I wish to work in one day, and there is a rich variety of different typographic designs that have been used across sports such as Football, Formula 1, Cricket and the Winter Olympics - all of which I explore on the site. I have chosen the colour scheme of Cream/Blue as it is professional, and my banner image sets out TypoGodfrey's status as 'the home of type'. The logo, a blue T surrounded by faded, symmetrical stripes, is a reference to *DixonBaxi's* motion stripes used in their Premier League.
