    <p class="MARGINTOP">Originally from Bournemouth, I am a second-year Media, Journalism and Publishing student at Oxford Brookes University. My first taste of journalism was in Year 9, covering school sports teams teams and writing website blog posts.
<br><br>
        Prior to university, I spent time as an intern at Yahoo News and HuffPost UK, as well as learning key marketing and branding skills at The Goat Agency. I undertook three stints of Work Experience at Yahoo! News and Sport, contributing multiple articles, as well as assisting on Yahoo Sports' flagship "The Football Show". 
        
        <br> <br>In addition, I was responsible for the Yahoo! News and Yahoo! Sport Twitter accounts, helping maintain a constant flow of content output in association with other journalists.
        ​
        In this time, my articles regularly appeared on the Yahoo! homepage. From this experience, I developed further my writing and editorial skills. I am currently an ambassador and writer for the political and media literacy network ShoutOut UK. For more, go to <a href= https://www.thomasgodfrey.co.uk> thomasgodfrey.co.uk </a> <br> <br> 

        In August 2019 I spent a week of Work Experience at the Goat Agency in central London. During this time, I slotted into a live campaigns team - managing social media campaigns worth up to £50,000 for some of the world's biggest brands, such as Hussle and Western Union. I also participated in training schemes, contributing to a group session on identifying 'influencer fraud' through the use of pod groups.
        ​</P>
    <br>
        <p> In just one week, I picked up the skills required for influencer marketing and closed deals with some of the UK's largest influencers, as well as producing over 150 outreach leads.

<p class="MARGINTOP MARGINBOTTOM"> Outside of work, I enjoy a range of sports, including Cricket, Football and Formula 1, as well as Softball - a sport I play for the University's team.</p>

<p class="MARGINBOTTOM MARGINTOP"> In 2019 I arranged, presented and produced a Student Issues debate in the lead up to that year's General Election. In the days following the live event, held at Twynham School in Christchurch with a live audience of 400, I edited and uploaded the full 55 minute version in video and podcast form, as well as an edited highlights edition, available to view below. The full version is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k7WFbXuNtA"> available on Youtube.</a>
