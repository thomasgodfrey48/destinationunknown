As the nation's broadcaster, the BBC has been a key perveyor of sports coverage since its inception in 1936. By June 1937, BBC Television broadcast the All England Tennis Championships (Wimbledon) for the first time, marking the first sport broadcast made on UK TV. A year later, the FA Cup was brought to the small screen, which, excluding the closure of BBC TV during World War II, has been broadcast ever since.

Live broadcasts first became a feature in 1954 with the World Cup beamed in from the Wankdorfstadion in Switzerland, with staple Match of the Day first entering screens in 1964.

The BBC continued to broadcast sport across its new channels without any form of centralised branding until 1988, when the first BBC Sport visua identity was introduced. Prior to this, individual shows had used their own branding, such as Grandstand and Sportsnight, but without any central, core identity. 

The new ident coincided with the formation of the BBC's Sport unit itself, as, prior to the late-80's, sports had been controlled by indivudual channel controllers (including David Attenbrough, who, as controller of BBC 2, founded the Floodlit Rugby League TV Trophy in 1965. It ran until 1980).
